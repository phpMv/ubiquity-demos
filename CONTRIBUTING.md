# Contributing to Ubiquity Demos

First off, thank you to intend to contribute, and to take time to do. :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Ubiquity Demos project.

## How Can I Contribute?
### Reporting Bugs
- Make sure to report only a bug relative to the demo code. 
### Creating a new Demo relative to a feature
- Check in the main `Readme` file that the feature is not already implemented in a Demo project.
- Each demo project must only concern one feature, or a coherent group of features.
- Write your code respecting [coding guide](https://micro-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/coding.html).
- Open a new GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/phpMv/ubiquity-demos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) with your demo.

### Writing a patch that fixes a bug
- Open a new GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/phpMv/ubiquity-demos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) with the patch
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable
